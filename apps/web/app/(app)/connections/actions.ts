"use server"

/**
 * The three ways a connection gets created, all of them server-side. Which one
 * runs is decided by what the connector's own authorization server advertises,
 * never by a setting:
 *
 * 1. CLIENT CREDENTIALS — the server offers the grant and the user brought an id
 *    and a secret. One POST, no browser round trip, done before the page
 *    repaints. This is the shortest honest path and it is tried first.
 * 2. AUTHORIZATION CODE — everything else. Discover, obtain a client id
 *    (registering one via RFC 7591 if the server allows it, so the user types
 *    nothing at all), then send the browser to consent. Nothing is stored until
 *    the code comes back to /oauth/callback.
 * 3. TOKEN PASTE — for a service that just hands out a long-lived token.
 *
 * All three replaced a form asking for a base URL, an auth type, and ciphertext
 * the user had to produce by SSHing to the gateway host and running a CLI.
 *
 * P0: every action re-verifies the caller against Convex with their own session
 * token. `connectorId` is only ever used to look up a shipped manifest, so a
 * hand-crafted id resolves to nothing rather than to a host of the caller's
 * choosing.
