/**
 * The flow state that has to survive a round trip through someone else's
 * consent screen: the PKCE verifier, the client credentials in use, and where
 * to redeem the code.
 *
 * It lives in ONE sealed httpOnly cookie rather than a database table. The
 * table would need a schema, an index, a TTL and a sweeper for rows abandoned
 * by every user who opened a consent screen and closed the tab; the cookie
 * expires by itself and the browser holds ciphertext this process alone can
 * open. `state` travels inside the sealed blob AND in the URL, and the callback
 * refuses unless they match, which is what makes a code delivered to a callback
 * nobody started useless.
 *
 * ponytail: one flow at a time per browser — starting a second connect
 * overwrites the first. Give the cookie a per-flow name if parallel connects
 * ever matter.
